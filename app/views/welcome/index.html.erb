<h3>Welcome to your personal quick pick app for the lottery.  Your lottery retailer's quick pick machine gives each digit, 0 - 9, the same odds of being chosen for your lottery ticket.  But do these digits appear in your life at an equal rate?  No, they don't.  This app will figure out for you what the probability should be of each digit being drawn for your lottery ticket.  Why not set the probability of your personal quick pick app to the same probability that they appear in your life?  Using this site is simple.  Sign up, fill out your number diary, then draw as many three digit, four digit, or mega lottery tickets as you want.</h3>
